# WebVR Mouse Control

This demonstrates an experimental virtual reality mouse interaction where the mouse cursor is de-coupled from head movement. Moving the mouse left and right moves the cursor in a circle around the user. Moving forward and back moves the cursor vertically. The distance of the cursor is either determined by the mouse wheel or projected onto the nearest object in a given direction.

Load this site in an experimental WebVR build of either [Firefox](http://mozvr.com) or [Chrome](http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/08/20/updated-firefox-vr-builds/). When the Rift is connected, hit the "Enter" key or click the "VR" button to enter full-screen VR mode. Hit "Escape" to exit VR and release the mouse cursor.
